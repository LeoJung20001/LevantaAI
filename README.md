# LevantaAI
An app that helps you remember to get up!

# The ideia
As a programmer, we usually spend countless hours sitting down, right? Who has never felt that pain, in the eye or in various parts of the body. Thinking about this I created an application that reminds you to stand up periodically. You can set the app to remind you to get up every 30 minutes or so (but we don't recommend spending more than 30 minutes sitting).

The project is in the initial phase, but looks promising.
